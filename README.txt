Why Jetwick?
============

Primary I developed jetwick to get a better twitter search.

I'm using twitter as a bookmarking service and needed to search my account often.
Also I wanted to know about which topics a user tweets about.
And I wanted to sort a search against retweets to be able to stay days away
from twitter and get the most important news about a special topic.

All of this is possible with jetwick. For more details take a look at this site:
