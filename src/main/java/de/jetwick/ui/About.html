                        Advertisment. It is easy to create an advertisment for jetwick.com:
                    </div>
                    <ul class="show-dots">
                        <li>
                            Create a tweet with your headline and add a link if you like.
                            Then add the hashtag #jetwick and your own hashtags
                            (which represents the keywords where you want that your ad will be shown too)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If this tweet is then retweeted it is likely to be shown.
                            (At the moment only one retweet is necessary. This will be increased in the future.)
                            Your tweet then will 'fight' against the other advertisments booked for the entered keyword.
                            The tweet with the most retweets will win.
                            (This will probably change in future so that more relevant tweets will win)
                            If two or more tweets have the same retweet number both will have the same probability to be shown.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After 3 days the advertisment is removed.
                        </li>

                        Why we named it 'Jetwick'?

                    <div class="about-desc">
                        You might think that we combined jetty and wicket, some Java software we use.
                        But the truth is that the initial name was 'Yatwic' which we derived from '<b>Y</b>et <b>A</b>nother <b>Twi</b>tter <b>C</b>lient'.
                        The spelling was a bit awkward so we changed it to its faster brother Jetwick.

                        By the way: At the beginning we didn't use wicket.
