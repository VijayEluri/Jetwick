        <h4>When you use Jetsli.de you accept the following terms and privacy statements.</h4>
        <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We cannot guarantee to be 100% available although we try
                hard to reach this. We can even stop Jetsli.de
                at any time although we try to inform you via
                <a href="http://twitter.com/jetwick">twitter.com/jetwick</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                You accept that we can post tweets (if you requested that) or get tweets
                with the help of your twitter account.
            </li>
            <li>
                We have no control over the published tweets and
                we cannot take the responsibility for this content
                which may contain links to abusive or even spam sites.
                Although we try hard to filter out spam
            </li>
            <li>
                You must not use Jetsli.de for illegal actions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We save tracking information for maximal one month.
                This includes your IP address, browser type,
                the referring domain, pages visited and search terms.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you login we store your twitter access tokens e.g. to get
                all the tweets from your friends.
            </li>
            <li>
                We store a temporal cookie when you use Jetsli.de.
                An additional cookie is stored for maximal one month to
                avoid that you need to newly login every time you come back
                to Jetsli.de e.g. after restarting the browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                You agree that Google is allowed to store an addtional cookie for 
                our advertisments. You also allow that Google uses 
                web beacons to track information gained from your visits on Jetslide.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your data (like saved searches) is safe on Jetsli.de
                although you agree that we do take the responsibility
                after a loss of this data.
