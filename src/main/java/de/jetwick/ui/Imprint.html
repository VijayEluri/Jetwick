        <h4>When you use Jetwick.com you accept the terms and privacy statements.</h4>
        <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We cannot guarantee to be 100% available although we try
                hard to reach this. We can even stop Jetwick.com
                at any time although we try to inform you via
                <a href="http://twitter.com/jetwick">twitter.com/jetwick</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                We have no control over the tweets
                (content which is posted through twitter.com)
                and
                we cannot take the responsibility for this content
                which may contain links to abusive or even spam sites.
                Although we try hard to filter out spam
            </li>
            <li>
                You must not use Jetwick.com for illegal actions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We save tracking information for maximum one month.
                This includes your IP address, browser type,
                the referring domain, pages visited and search terms.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you login we store access tokens e.g. to get
                all the tweets from your friends. When you log out these
                tokens will be removed.
            </li>
            <li>
                We store a temporal cookie when you actually use Jetwick.com.
                An additional cookie is stored for maximal one month to
                avoid that you need to newly login every time you come back
                to Jetwick.com e.g. after restarting the browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your data (like saved searches) is safe on Jetwick.com
                although you agree that we do take the responsibility
                after a loss of this data.
            </li>
        </ul>
